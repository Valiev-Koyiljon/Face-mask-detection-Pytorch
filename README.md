## üß† Project Overview

This project detects whether a person is wearing a **face mask** in real time using deep learning and computer vision. Built with **PyTorch**, **OpenCV**, and **MTCNN**, it classifies faces as either:

* üò∑ **With Mask**
* üò∂ **Without Mask**

It promotes public health by enabling real-time monitoring using a webcam, and is trained on labeled image data.

---

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used is provided in `mask_images_ready.zip`, containing labeled images split into:

* `with_mask`
* `without_mask`

To use the dataset:

1. Download `mask_images_ready.zip`
2. Extract it into your project directory
3. Use it for training/testing the model

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Required Versions:**

* Python ‚â• 3.6
* `torch==2.0.1`
* `torchvision==0.9.1`
* `MTCNN==0.1.12`
* `opencv-python==4.5.3.56`
* `numpy==1.21.5`
* `Pillow==8.3.2`
* `matplotlib==3.7.1`

---

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Train the Model

Open and run the following notebook in **Google Colab** or locally (with GPU support):

```
model.ipynb
```

* Follow in-notebook instructions
* Ensure your dataset is organized as `with_mask/` and `without_mask/`
* Train and save your model

### 2. Real-Time Inference

After training:

Open this notebook in **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab** (‚ö†Ô∏è Not Google Colab):

```
realTimeDetection.ipynb
```

* Connect a webcam
* Run the notebook to begin real-time face mask detection

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

* **Colab users**: Google Colab cannot access your local webcam, so use it only for training.
* **Webcam access**: For real-time detection, ensure your device has a functional camera and use Jupyter locally.
