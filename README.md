# Face-mask-detection-Pytorch

Face Mask Detection: PyTorch, OpenCV, Python, and MTCNN, this project detects face mask presence. It combines deep learning, computer vision, and real-time video processing. Trained on labeled data, the system evaluates accuracy and loss. Promote public health and safety with this mask detection solution.
 
 This project contains two .ipynb files. First one "Facemask_detection_last1_Final.ipynb" is for training deep learning model for facemask detection. The second file "RealTimeFaceMaskDetecter.ipynb" file for openning camera and checking our model on real time.
